0.2.0.2		HE  WENT  TO  THE  DOOR  OF  THE  MASTER

0.2.0.3		"WHO  ARE  YOU  WHO  WISHES  TO  STUDY  HERE"  ASKED  THE  MASTER

0.2.0.4		THE  STUDENT  TOLD  THE  MASTER  HIS  NAME

0.2.0.5		"THAT  IS  NOT  WHO  YOU  ARE,  THAT  IS  ONLY  WHAT  YOU  ARE  CALLED

0.2.0.6		WHO  ARE  YOU  WHO  WISHES  TO  STUDY  HERE"  HE  ASKED  AGAIN

0.2.0.7		THE  MAN  THOUGHT  FOR  A  MOMENT,  AND  REPLIED  "I  AM  A  PROFESSOR"

0.2.0.8		"THAT  IS  WHAT  YOU  DO,  NOT  WHO  YOU  ARE,"  REPLIED  THE  MASTER

0.2.0.9		"WHO  ARE  YOU  WHO  WISHES  TO  STUDY  HERE"

0.2.0.10	CONFUSED,  THE  MAN  THOUGHT  SOME  MORE

0.2.0.11	FINALLY,  HE  ANSWERED,  "I  AM  A  HUMAN  BEING"

0.2.0.12	"THAT  IS  ONLY  YOUR  SPECIES,  NOT  WHO  YOU  ARE

0.2.0.13	WHO  ARE  YOU  WHO  WISHES  TO  STUDY  HERE",  ASKED  THE  MASTER  AGAIN

0.2.0.14	AFTER  A  MOMENT  OF  THOUGHT,  THE  PROFESSOR  REPLIED  "I  AM  A  CONSCIOUSNESS  INHABITING  AN  ARBITRARY  BODY"

0.2.0.15	"THAT  IS  MERELY  WHAT  YOU  ARE,  NOT  WHO  YOU  ARE

0.2.0.16	WHO  ARE  YOU  WHO  WISHES  TO  STUDY  HERE"

0.2.0.17	THE  MAN  WAS  GETTING  IRRITATED

0.3.0.0		THE  LOSS  OF  DIVINITY

0.3.0.1		THE  CIRCUMFERENCE  PRACTICES  THREE  BEHAVIORS  WHICH  CAUSE  THE  LOSS  OF  DIVINITY

0.3.0.2		CONSUMPTION

0.3.0.3		WE  CONSUME  TOO  MUCH  BECAUSE  WE  BELEIVE  THE  FOLLWING  TWO  ERRORS  WITHIN  THE  DECEPTION

0.3.0.4		1    WE  DO  NOT  HAVE  ENOUGH,  OR  THERE  IS  NOT  ENOUGH

0.3.0.6		MOST  THINGS  ARE  NOT  WORTH  CONSUMING

0.3.0.7		PRESERVATION

0.3.0.8		WE  PRESERVE  THINGS  BECAUSE  WE  BELIEVE  WE  ARE  WEAK

0.3.0.10	THIS  IS  THE  DECEPTION

0.3.0.11	MOST  THINGS  ARE  NOT  WORTH  PRESERVING

0.3.0.13	WE  FOLLOW  DOGMA  SO  THAT  WE  CAN  BELONG  AND  BE  RIGHT;  OR  WE  FOLLOW  REASON  SO  WE  CAN  BELONG  AND  BE  RIGHT

0.3.0.14	THERE  IS  NOTHING  TO  BE  RIGHT  ABOUT;  TO  BELONG  IS  DEATH

0.3.0.15	IT  IS  THE  BEHAVIORS  OF  CONSUMPTION,  PRESERVATION  AND  ADHERENCE  THAT  HAVE  US  LOSE  OUR  PRIMALITY,  AND  THUS  OUR  DIVINITY

0.4.0.3		WHEN  ASKED  BY  A  STUDENT  TO  EXPLAIN  WHAT  THAT  MEANT;  THE  MASTER  SAID  "IT  IS  A  VOICE  INSIDE  YOUR  HEAD"

0.4.0.4		"I  DON'T  HAVE  A  VOICE  IN  MY  HEAD,"  THOUGHT  THE  STUDENT,  AND  HE  RAISED  HIS  HAND  TO  TELL  THE  MASTER

0.4.0.5		THE  MASTER  STOPPED  THE  STUDENT,  AND  SAID  "THE  VOICE  THAT  JUST  SAID  YOU  HAVE  NO  VOICE  IN  YOUR  HEAD;  IS  THE  I"
